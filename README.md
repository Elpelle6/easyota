# Easy OTA

Easily share Ad-Hoc iOS applications. Instead of having to send the file, add to iTunes and sync, visit a page on your iPhone and install directly

## Warning

Consider this an early alpha. I build this quickly to share some files, and it probably has some security issues.
Patches welcome, of course :)

## Installation

* Clone the repository
* Make sure your webserver can write the `apps` directory
